I created  Weather Application that takes weather and wind speed information from Open Meteo API and timezone information of a location from timezonedb. 
My code works by inputing a location in the search box which the JavaScript code takes and searches using Open Street map and ten converts to a longitude and latitude to be searched in Open Meteo.
It then displays the weather information, time zone and windspeed.
